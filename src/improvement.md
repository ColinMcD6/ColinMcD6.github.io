# Areas of Improvement

After Iteration 2 of the project, we identified several areas that need improvement to enhance our overall efficiency and effectiveness of out team. We came up with several areas of improvement:

**Communication Frequency**: We noticed our communication was too infrequent keep track of our progress. This lead to a last-minute rush resulting in unnecessary stress and a less efficient workflow.

To address the communication challenges we held short team meetings after each class and once over the weekend. During these meetings, each team member provided an update on their current tasks, what theyâ€™ve accomplished, and what is left to do. This ensured that we have the time to address any issues or adjustments needed. We found this greatly improved our team's communication and contributed to Iteration 3 tasks being completed on schedule.

**Setting Deadlines**: We did set specific deadlines for individual developer tasks. This lack of deadlines contributed to leaving a lot of work close to the deadline.

For Iteration 3, we set specific deadlines for each developer task in GitLab. This helped us with stay on track with our planning and improved our productivity.

**Unit Testing**: We did not focus enough on testing our code. In Iteration 1 and Iteration 2 our test coverage was below 80%.

To improve unit test coverage, refactored our existing code to enhance test coverage where tests were previously missing. We were able to achieve 80% test coverage for our codebase.
