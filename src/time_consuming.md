# Most Time Consuming Tasks

While the project involved a lot of individual and group work. There were certain tasks that were more challenging and took longer than expected. Wrtiting tests for features often took longer than writing the code fore presentation, logic, and database which was not expected. However, the tests saved time in the long run by immediately detecting when are newer changes broke the functionality of the app.

Implementing the HSQLDB database also took longer than expected and was more challenging than anticipated. Part of the challenge was due unfamiliarity with the technology but are large part was due to the lack of database visualization and diagnostic tools. 

User Interface components with a large range of behavior took much longer to develop than simple features. For instance, the login user interface and logic took much less time than the search and filter feature.
