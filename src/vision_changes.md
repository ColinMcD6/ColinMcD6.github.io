# How Our Project Vision Changed

In our original vision statement, we mentioned two features that we were not able to implement. The two features were to display the recipe steps dynamically and to have additional search filters. The reason we did not implement these features is due to time constraints on each iteration, and it would require a major restructuring of our codebase.
